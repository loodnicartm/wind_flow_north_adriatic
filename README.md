# wind_flow_north_adriatic
This R script visualizes wind flow patterns in the Northern Adriatic region using u and v wind vector components. It combines geospatial raster processing with elegant vector field plotting to highlight dominant wind directions and intensities across space and time.

-Key Features:
Load and process gridded wind data (u and v components) in raster format.

Calculate wind speed and direction per grid cell.

Create vector field (arrow) plots over a base map to visualize wind flow.

Customize plots with coastlines, geographic context, and color scales.

-Technologies & Libraries Used:
raster, terra, sf, rgdal – for spatial data handling

ggplot2, rnaturalearth, ggspatial – for map visualization

dplyr, tidyr – for data wrangling and preparation

-Applications:
Meteorological visualization of wind regimes

Support for marine navigation, offshore planning, or renewable energy siting

Educational tools for understanding wind dynamics in coastal zones
